## Project Overview

The Myra Rover is designed with flexibility and extensibility in mind, featuring:

- Multiple control interfaces for various use cases
- Robust power management system
- Intelligent navigation capabilities
- Modular architecture for easy maintenance and upgrades

## Repository Links

- [Motor Controller](https://github.com/ShivanshGhelani/Myra-Rover-motor-controller.git) - Motor control implementation
- [Ground Controller](https://github.com/ShivanshGhelani/Myra-Rover-motor-controller.git) - Ground station interface and remote control

## Control Modes

The Myra Rover supports multiple control modes for versatile operation:

1. **WiFi-Controlled**

   - Direct wireless control over WiFi network
2. **Voice-Controlled**

   - Voice command support through Ground Station/Controller
3. **Hand Gesture Based**

   - Gesture recognition via Ground Controller
4. **Semi-Autonomous Features**

   - Obstacle Avoidance (Partially implemented)
   - Lane Following (In Progress, using Computer Vision)

## Hardware Specifications

### Motor Control System

- **Motor Drivers:**
  - L298N (Analog Speed Controller)
  - TB6612FNG (PWM Speed Controller)

### Microcontrollers

- **ESP32 #1:**

  - Dedicated to motor control logic
  - Refer to motor control repository for implementation details
- **ESP32 #2:**

  - Handles main logic control
  - Processes commands from Ground Controller
  - Refer to logic controller repository for details

### Input Devices

- GamePAD for input control and mode switching
  - See ground control repository for implementation

## Power Requirements

### Recommended Setup

- **Motors:** 4S Battery configuration
- **Logic:** 2S Battery configuration
- **Total:** 6S configuration
- **Specifications:** 12V, 5A for optimal performance and extended operation

### Minimum Setup

- **Total:** 4S configuration
- **Specifications:** 9V, 3A
- **Note:** May experience jerky movement

### Power Management

- **Recommended Components:**

  - DC-DC Buck and Boost converters
  - 1000¬µF, 25V capacitor for power stabilization
  - Alternative capacitor ratings can be used based on specific buck/boost converter and battery configurations
- **Stability Measures:**

  - Use buck/boost converters for both logic and motor power
  - Capacitor implementation helps prevent power cutoffs and reboot issues
